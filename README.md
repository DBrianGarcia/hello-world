# hello-world
The first repo I've ever write in GitHub.

Hello pedestrians!

I'm master Brian, and I've determined to learn everything that is supposed to be learned about GitHub and it's facilities in order to CONQUER THE WORLD!!!!

Just kiding. I'm expecting to have a great learning experience and improve my (basic) data-science skills. Also, call me if you wanna go to the cinema or a wrestling event. I'd love it.
